# Memory Game Project

This Udacity project is designed to show my use of JavaScript.  The starter code had to be transformed from a static, non-interactive version, to a fully usable Memory Game.

## Installing

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open `index.html` insode your browser.

## Game play

The game consists of eight different pairs of cards.  These are randomly shuffled and placed face-down on the board.

The user needs to flip-over 2 cards at a time (by clicking on them), to find the matching pairs.

* If the cards match, they will stay face up.
* If the cards do not match, they will return face-down.

The aim is to match all the cards in the quickest time!
